# DigiPen GitHub Education Demo - Getting Started with GitHub Classroom

**Sign in to GitHub or Create an account If you already have a GitHub account proceed to the next step.**

**[GitHub](https://github.com) is free and is widely used throughout the industry.**

## Create a GitHub Account

- Navigate to **[GitHub.com](https://github.com)** and make a new account if you do not already have one.
- Create a username.
  - Most people have only one GitHub account that gets registered as a "contributor" to organizations and other repositories. So make sure it is something professional, or at least not unprofessional, and you are comfortable keeping.
  - Changing your username is a slight process and can have side effects like links not being updated.
- You may/should use your personal email address as the primary email.
  - We will register your DigiPen email later.
- Select "Next: Select a plan"
- Select "Choose Free"
- Verify your email address and then click "Complete setup"

### Email Settings

#### Add your digipen.edu email

- Go to your [GitHub email settings (you can click this link)](https://github.com/settings/emails) and enter your digipen.edu email address so we can link it with your GitHub username.
- I prefer to check both of the following checkboxes, but these are optional
  - Keep my email address private
  - Block command line pushes that expose my email
    - Read more **[here](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/blocking-command-line-pushes-that-expose-your-personal-email-address)**.
    - If you set this, you will have to edit your local git config file to set your email, but you should set this anyway. See **[here](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address)**.
- Also, set up your email preferences at the bottom of the page

**Note**: I would highly recommend you set up 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) in your **[GitHub security settings](https://github.com/settings/security)**. However, it is not required.

## Register to the GitHub Organization

  - This allows GitHub Classroom to create your repositories.

  - This will add you to the appropriate "students" groups which gives you access to the GitHub Org.
  - If this step fails, message me and we will get it fixed.
